# Welcome to the API documentation.

Although delivered as a bundle, `futils` is divided into several packages which you can see in the navigation. Each package contains functions which fit specific purposes. You can find a complete description of all packages below.

## Packages by purpose
| Package     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arity       | Contains function decorators which manipulate another functions arity. Most often used functions usually are `monadic`, `dyadic`, `tetradic` and so on. The decorators appear to more useful when writing higher-order functions than day-to-day programming.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Combinators | A package inspired by "How to mock a mockingbird" and higher-order function combinators. The functions used most often are `pipeÂ´ and `compose`. But also higher-order-logical function combinators like `and` can be found here.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Decorators  | If you need to attach specific behaviours to functions, this package is for you. Some examples? `curry`, `partial`, `not`, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Lenses      | Distributes functions to work with van Laarhoven style lenses. Provides `makeLenses`, `over`, `set`, `view` and `lens` functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Monads      | Exports all Monad constructors as well as some utility functions. The Monad constructors provided cover a wide area of usecases and contain for example `IO`, `Maybe`, `Either`, and `Task`. The utility functions `liftA2`, `liftA3`, `liftA4` and `liftA5` simplify the writing of monadic code even further.                                                                                                 |
| Monoids     | Apart from most of the monads being monoids, some more basic types of monoids are provided by this package.  Like the Monads package, the functions and constructors from the Monoids package help in writing your application as a pure transformation of state. You will find things like `Fn`, `Additive` and `All` in this package.                                                                         |
| Operators   | A collection of higher-order functions which work mostly on collections like `Array`, `{}` and Monads/Monoids. If you work a lot with function composition, the functions from Operators are your day-to-day bread-and-butter tools, like `map`, `field`, `concat`, `flatMap`, `find`, etc.                                                                                                                     |
| Trampolines | Recursion. Recursion. A lot of JavaScript engines have already started to support tail-call-optimized function execution. A lot more have disabled it behind a certain flag, which effectively makes it unsupported. Some don't have it. And some transpilers will never gonna have it. However, with the Trampolines package, you can write tail-call-optimized functions by using `trampoline` and `suspend`. |
| Transducers | Implementation of a subset of some transducers, with respect to the [Transformer protocol](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#transformer-protocol). This increases interoperability with other libraries. You will find the transducers package functions under `futils.transducers`. This is a list of some of the provided transducers: `map`, `filter`, `take`, `partition`, `dropWhile`.     |
| Types       | When writing JavaScript, we almost always need to determine the type of arguments. At least I need to. If you are anything like me, this package is for you: `isNil`, `isString`, `isMonad`, `isArrayOf` and other goodies are waiting to be explored.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Maths       | A small package containing helper functions for usual math operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Newtypes  | _Experimental package_  Implementation of functional types which allow for pattern matching                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
