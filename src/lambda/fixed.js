 * The fixed function. For a given function f, returns a function g which

 * package
 * @method fixed
 * @memberof module:lambda
 * @param {Function} f the initial function
 * @return {Function} The fixed point of f
 *
 * @example

 *
 * const factorial = fixed((fact) => (n) => n < 1 ? 1 : n * fact(n - 1));

 * factorial(6); // -> 720
