/**
 * The map function. Map takes a function and maps it over the value(s)
 * of a data structure. It returns a new structure of the same type.
 * This is the natural behaviour of Promises when using the .then function,
 * except that if you return a Promise with the value inside it,
 * the returned Promise has only a single level (it naturally flattens).
 * @method map
 * @memberof module:operation
 * @param {Function} f The function to map with
 * @param {Functor|Promise} a A Functor interface implementing type or a Promise
 * @return {Functor|Promise} A new instance of the Functor or Promise
 *
 * @example
 * const {map} = require('futils').operation;
 *
 * map((a) => a.toUpperCase(), ['a', 'b']); // -> ['A', 'B']
 * map((a) => a.toUpperCase());       // -> (Functor -> Functor)
