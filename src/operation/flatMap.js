/**
 * The flatMap function which maps a function which returns a data
 * structure over a structure of the same type and flattens the result one level.
 * This is the natural behaviour of Promises when using the .then function,
 * because if you return a Promise, the returned Promise has only a single level.
 * @method flatMap
 * @memberof module:operation
 * @param {Function} f The function to flatMap with
 * @param {Monad|Array|Promise} a Any Array and/or Monad interface implementing type, as well as Promise
 * @return {Monad|Array|Promise} A new instance of the Array or Monad or Promise
 *
 * @example
 * const {flatMap} = require('futils').operation;
 *
 * flatMap((a) => [a.toUpperCase()], ['a', 'b']); // -> ['A', 'B']
 * flatMap((a) => [a.toUpperCase()]);             // -> (Monad -> Monad)
